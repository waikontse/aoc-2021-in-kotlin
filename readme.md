This is my approach on Advent of code 2021 with Kotlin in a functional style.
For me, it is all about learning Kotlin, functional style, and having fun while doing it.

## Code organization

Each puzzle of the day will have a corresponding class name Day<N>.kt which solves that particular puzzle, for both parts 1 and 2.
There is also a companion unit test which checks that the return values of a solved puzzle is the expected value.
